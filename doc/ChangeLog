2014-XX-XX - Changes in version 2014.XX.X:
  - Extend the spec and fix several issues.  This should fix bug
    <https://bugs.torproject.org/10893>.  Thanks to Yawning Angel.
  - Use a randomly generated fallback password if the bridge operator did not
    use Tor's ServerTransportOptions.
  - Fix bug <https://bugs.torproject.org/11100> which broke the server's key
    rotation.  Patch by Yawning Angel.
  - Fix bug <https://bugs.torproject.org/11092> to prevent denial-of-service
    attacks targeting the authentication mechanism.  The problem was pointed

2014-01-19 - Changes in version 2014.01.b:
  - More unit tests and several minor bug fixes.
  - Sanitise shared secret if the user got it slightly wrong.

2014-01-09 - Changes in version 2014.01.a:
  - Update API to be compatible with recent obfsproxy changes.
  - Improve argument parsing.

2013-11-18 - Changes in version 2013.11.a:
  - Revert UniformDH group size back to 1536 bits to have less of a timing
    distinguisher at the cost of having less effective security.  Note that
    this also breaks compatibility with version 2013.10.a!
  - Add the config option "USE_IAT_OBFUSCATION" which can be used to disable
    inter-arrival time obfuscation.  This would mean more throughput at the
    cost of being slightly more detectable.
  - Add a fast FIFO buffer implementation.
  - Refactored plenty of code.
  - Add this ChangeLog file.

2013-10-02 - Changes in version 2013.10.a:
  - First public release of ScrambleSuit.
